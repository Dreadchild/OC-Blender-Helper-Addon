**Megascans Module**

* **Since v3.0.0, the Megascans module no longer listens to the Bridge App. Instead, megascans assets can be automatically detected by Octane Helper, and you can locate them in Assets library alongside with any other asset you have**
  * This means, do not click the Export button in the Bridge App. You just need to download them and use them in Octane Helper's Assets Library :) 
* The imported surface material can be found in Material Slots
  * It will not automatically  be applied to selected objects
  * You can also use Right-Click menu > Paste Material to paste the surface material to selected
