## Questions

* Megascans Livelink module does not respond to imports
  * Some assets' meshes cannot be imported due to issues with built-in fbx/obj importer, which will be fixed in the future
  * Starting from 2020, when you first time launch the Bridge App and click the "Download Plugin", the Bridge App automatically puts an Blender addon that occupies the port communicating with Bridge at startup into **C:\Users\\[Your username]\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.9[X]\scripts\startup** (Windows). It's called "MSPlugin", please remove the folder and restart the Blender
  * There is no on/off button for the official quixel addon that is why you have to remove it for using Octane. If you want to use the addon for cycles/eevee again, just simply recover the official addon, then the Octane megascans module will keep silent
* Other issues
  * Please check out the log from Blender > Top Bar > Window > Toggle System Console and let me know what's happening
