## Installation

* Preferences > Add-ons > Install
* Select Octane_Helper.zip to install
* Activate it

## How to use

* Pretty simple, just **right click** in the 3D viewport
* Make sure the Octane render is enabled, otherwise the menu will not show up
* It works in either object mode or edit mode, but provides different functions

## WIP

* Toggle clay mode rendering
* Popup dialog for users to change some settings when adding materials
  * e.g. RGB color and emission power of the lights
* Menu to create octane-related objects 
  * e.g. Directional light, backdrops
